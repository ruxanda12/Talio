# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Stoyan Markov
Minute taker: Gerrit Croes

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The chair and meeting were decided ahead of time and came prepared.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda was provided on Mattermost in time, but please remember to add it to the Git repository as well. It was well prepared and followed the agenda template nicely. The various points that should be discussed in the meeting were also clear.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker (Stoyan)

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: I was not able to find the notes in the git repository. Please add these for next week and then I can have another look at them. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: All topics in the agenda were nicely covered and Stoyan also made sure to focus the discussion on the current agenda topic. During the planning phase the meeting was a bit more free flowing and less regulated, but this was okay since it is a more brainstorming focused section of the meeting. However, maybe try to bring the focus back to the topic at hand a bit more when the group gets off-topic. 

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: There is always a nice atmosphere in the meetings - everyone contributes to the discussion and has fun at the same time. It is also nice that agreements and discussed topics are recapped a bit throughout the meeting, since this ensures that everyone is on the same page. 

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There is no current application yet, but I can see that you are enthusiastic about starting to code and will surely do so this week. You have made concrete plans in the meeting today, so if you follow through with these then I hope that you will be on track. Remember to show me the state of your application at our next meeting.
