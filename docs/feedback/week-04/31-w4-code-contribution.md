# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

#### Focused Commits

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: There is a good number of commits in the repository. Additionally, most commits have clear titles and only affect a small number of files. However, this is not always the case: [this commit](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-31/-/commit/6ff12b03cc9484dcbde65664ec973e09562cb283) for example makes significant changes in 10 files, and [this commit](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-31/-/commit/2a9ffdf828fc66b87be71b4126b6f1ff1b806484) is not clearly named, so that its purpose is not clear. Try to consistently write coherent and concise commits.


#### Isolation

Grade: Excellent

Feedback: You do a good job at using separate branches and merge requests to isolate the individual features during development. The merges also have a good scope, well done!


#### Reviewability

Grade: Good

Feedback: Your merge requests usually only cover a small number of commits, so it is relatively easy to understand what the focus of the merge request is. Your titles are also usually descriptive, but you should make more use of the descriptions that you can write for merge requests. [This](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-31/-/merge_requests/5) is an example of a merge request with a good description. In your merge request descriptions, you can expand on what you have implemented for the specific merge request, explain which limitations or problems your code might still have, link the issue that the code is related to, etc.


#### Code Reviews

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: All merge requests have some reviews and these seem to be reviewed in a timely manner. The reviews are also always constructive and goal-oriented. I also like that you use the code reviews not only to point out potential mistakes in the code, but also to ask questions about certain implementation decisions, as in [this merge request](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-31/-/merge_requests/4).


#### Build Server

Grade: Excellent

Feedback: You commit regularly, the build never fails on main and you have successfully selected 10 checkstyle rules. Good job!


Overall, you are doing a good job at interacting with various Git features like branches, merges and code reviews. Make sure that it is always easy to understand what the purpose of every commit and merge is by adding clear titles and descriptions.
