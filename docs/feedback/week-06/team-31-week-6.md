# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Gerrit Croes

Minute taker: Yuliiaa Shkekina

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and minute taker. 


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was provided ahead of the meeting and followed a good structure. The individual discussion points were clear and it was great to see that the agenda included room for feedback, questions and team interactions throughout. However, the agenda is still missing a slot in which you as a team demonstrate the current state of your application. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker (Gerrit)

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The notes were not on Git! Please upload them, since this will impact your Process grade.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: There was a nice overview at the beginning and I like that you reminded the team of what you have discussed so far and what is still to come. The agenda was not entirely followed throughout the meeting because other topics came up, but you still ensured that everything covered originally in the agenda was mentioned and dealt with the upcoming topics very flexibly. In the future, I would suggest that you can speak up more if the meeting gets off topic. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: It is great to see that everyone actively participated and contributed in the meeting. There were effective and open discussions and reflections about the planning of the project so far and the code contribution. I believe that the fact that you have these open and constructive discussions where everyone is involved will really help you make changes now that hopefully enable you to plan more effectively in future weeks. Additionally, the way in which everyone was open to receiving their feedback in the Buddycheck and how you reflected on it throughout the meeting was fantastic. My only remark is that sometimes multiple people spoke at once, so be careful not to speak over anyone in the future.  


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: So far, you don't yet have a shippable product. Like you said yourself, about a third of basic functionality has been implemented so far, and only once these have been completed I would consider the project 'shippable'. However, from the meeting I can tell that you will place more importance on planning more carefully this week, and I look forward to see how much you will have implemented by next week!
