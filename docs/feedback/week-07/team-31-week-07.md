# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Yuliia Shkekina

Minute taker: Maria Tudor

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda follows the provided template and covers all important topics. The individual points were clear, but in the future you could add some subpoints with further explanation so that the agenda becomes even easier to follow. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The notes are organised and easy to follow. However, I do not see any agreements made on code distribution - make sure that this is always included in the minutes for the week, so that everyone knows what they need to do. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: You ensured that all agenda topics were covered. The meeting was quite flexible and moved away from the agenda every now and then, but I think that it was still controlled and natural enough. In the future, you can be more involved in regulating the discussion throughout the meeting. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Everyone was involved in the discussion and contributed by asking questions and making suggestions. However, in the future you can take more ownership of the meeting, since I made suggestions throughout for the next topic to be discussed. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: A lot of the basic functionality is implemented. Definitely make sure that this is completely done by the deadline. From the planning in your meeting, it seems like you still have a shot at finishing functionality from the other epics as well.
