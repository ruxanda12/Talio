#### 1) Self-organization

» Was the team in charge? Did everybody speak? Was the tone respectful?

Sufficient

Since this was the first meeting, I took charge of the discussion more than I would in later weeks. I started the various discussions by introducing the next topic to be discussed, and then the group took hold of that topic and discussed it amongst themselves quite well. There were some slumps in the discussion at times, but overall all members in the team were involved in the discussion and the tone was friendly and respectful. 


#### 2) Suggested Topics

» Have all the suggested topics been covered? Did they try to moderate the meeting? You can point to the teamwork lecture, there they will learn what is expected from them.

Good

The suggested topics were covered: the meeting began with a round of introductions and then the team was eager to ask for any questions and clarifications they had about the projects, both amongst themselves and towards me. The code of conduct discussion was cut short, since the team wanted to have this discussion by themselves rather than using the time with me as the TA for these discussions. Then the team moved to discussions about the assignments and deadlines as well as the project topic themselves quite naturally. As the TA, I only initiated topics every now and then and led the discussion a bit to answer any questions about assignments and deadlines, but overall the team covered the suggested topics themselves.
